Hey everyone! My name is Alex.
Currently I'm working as a SDET at NBCUniversal. My job responsibilities are related to automation, testing and continuous integration. 

I am passionate about clean code and best practices of development.  Also I'm considering myself early adopter of technologies and big fan of optimizations. 

This blog is created to document all the solutions I came to during my day-to-day work. Usually these things can be extremely difficult to google and they could make someone's life easier. If they do such thing to yours, your comments are really appreciated :blush:
