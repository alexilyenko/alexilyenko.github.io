Hey everyone!

I'm Alex and I currently work as a SDET at Lyft. My job responsibilities mostly cover automation, testing and continuous integration in mobile platforms domain.

This blog is mainly created to document all the solutions I came to during my day-to-day work. Usually these things might be extremely difficult to google and I truly hope they make someone else's life easier.

Don't hesitate to drop any thoughts or suggestions in the comment sections. Cheers! :beer:
