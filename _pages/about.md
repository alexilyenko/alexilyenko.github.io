Hey everyone!

My name is Alex. Currently I work as an SDET at NBCUniversal in New York City. My job responsibilities include but are not limited by automation, testing and continuous integration. My main domain is Mobile and TV platforms.

I am passionate about clean code and best practices of development. Besides that I consider myself as an early adopter of technologies and big fan of optimizations.

This blog is created to document all the solutions I came to during my day-to-day work. Usually these things might be extremely difficult to google and I truly hope they can make someone's life easier. If they do such thing to yours, I will be happy!

Don't hesitate to drop any thoughts in the comment section below posts. Promise, I'll answer to each of them! :beer:
