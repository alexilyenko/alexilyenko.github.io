Hey everybody! My name is Alex.
Currently I'm working as a SDET at NBCUniversal. My job responsibilities are related to automation, testing and continuous integration. 

I am passionate about clean code and best practices of development.  Also I'm early adopter of technologies and big fan of optimizations. 

This blog is created to document all the solutions I came to during my day-to-day work. Usually these things can be extremely difficult to google and they can make someone's life much easier. If they do your comments are really appreciated :)
